### Lecture - 3 Foundation

1. package.json has script tag with the help of that we can run the command : npm run start , npm run build
2. npm run start - run the server
3. npm run build - build the code for production
4. npm run build -- --no-minify - build the code for production without minification
5. JSX make our developer life easy , JSX is not a requirement for using React. Using React without JSX is especially convenient when you don't want to set up compilation in your build environment.
6. Babel is JS compiler which is converted JSX into react.createEkement() function
7. Babel is a JavaScript compiler. Use next generation JavaScript, today.
8. Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. ( support new script in old browser )
